there are basically 4 types of joining are avalable 
1.
2.Innner joining
3.left joining
4.cross joining 




1.INNER JOIN or JOIN



1)SELECT * FROM person INNER JOIN city
ON person.cityid = city.cid;

second method (instated of writing full name of the person we only write person p,city c)
1)SELECT * FROM person p INNER JOIN city c
ON p.cityid = c.cid;

1)3table joining
SELECT * from ((person 
        INNER JOIN city ON person.cityid = city.cid)
        INNER JOIN course ON person.courceid = course.id);
                 
          
1)SELECT * from ((person p
        INNER JOIN city c ON p.cityid = c.cid)
        INNER JOIN course k ON p.courceid = k.id);
          
          
          

3)perticular column ne jova mate
SELECT p.id,p.name,p.percentage,p.age,p.gender,c.name
FROM person p INNER JOIN city c
ON p.cityid = c.cid;

4)we also use where in joining

SELECT p.id,p.name,p.percentage,p.age,p.gender,c.cityname
FROM person p INNER JOIN city c
ON p.cityid = c.cid
WHERE c.cityname = "bhavnagar" 
ORDER BY p.name;

4)inner joint is also called join.
  so.inner join and join both are same 
SELECT p.id,p.name,p.percentage,p.age,p.gender,c.cityname
FROM person p JOIN city c
ON p.cityid = c.cid
WHERE c.cityname = "bhavnagar" 
ORDER BY p.name;


5)joining of 3 tables

SELECT p.id,p.name,p.percentage,p.age,p.gender,c.cityname,course.cname
FROM ((person p 
INNER JOIN city c ON p.cityid = c.cid)
INNER JOIN course  ON p.courceid = course.id);

				or
SELECT p.id,p.name,p.percentage,p.age,p.gender,c.cityname,k.cname
FROM ((person p 
INNER JOIN city c ON p.cityid = c.cid)
INNER JOIN course k ON p.courceid = k.id);

2)LEFT JOIN & RIGHT JOIN
1)
SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN city
on person.cityid = city.cid;


3)right join
right join show the all data and also show the other table data which is not match with it.



4)cross join





grouup by
select COUNT(p.cityid),p.name, c.cityname
FROM person p   
INNER join city c
on p.cityid= c.cid
GROUP BY cityid
HAVING cityname="bhavnagar" AND ;

SELECT c.cityname, COUNT(p.cityid)
FROM person p INNER JOIN city c
on p.cityid = c.cid
GROUP BY cityid;
